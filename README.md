# Scriptyard

The aim of this repository is to reduce duplication of efforts across the group and to make it feel like the code you write might actually be worth the time you put into it. Deposit anything you've written that might be useful to other Exomollers. A few house rules:

1. When contributing new code, please create a dedicated subfolder for it, even if your code is only in a single file. This will help to make it clear what's what.

2. Code doesn't have to be pretty - this is a private repository - but please try to add a short description of what the code does to a README.md file in the subfolder for your code, and add a link to that README below. 

3. Also please make it clear who is reponsible for the code if it isn't obvious from your GitHub username.
