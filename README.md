# Scriptyard
A repository for sharing scraps of code between Exomol members that help with day-to-day processes. Dposit anything you've written that might be useful to other Exomollers.

Code doesn't have to be pretty - this is a private repository - but please try to add a short description of what the code does, and how to use it. Also please make it clear who is reponsible for the code if it isn't obvious from your GitHub username.

The aim of this repository is to reduce duplication of efforts across the group and to make it feel like the code you write might actually be worth the time you put into it.
