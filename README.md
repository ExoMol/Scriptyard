# Scriptyard
A repository for sharing scraps of code between Exomol members that help with day-to-day processes. Deposit anything you've written that might be useful to other Exomollers. Please create a new subfolder for all code contributions, even if your code is only in a single file. This will help to make it clear what's what. 

The aim of this repository is to reduce duplication of efforts across the group and to make it feel like the code you write might actually be worth the time you put into it. Code doesn't have to be pretty - this is a private repository - but please try to add a short description of what the code does to a README.md file in the subfolder for your code, before adding a link to it below. Also please make it clear who is reponsible for the code if it isn't obvious from your GitHub username.
